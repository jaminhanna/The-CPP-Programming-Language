6.1.2 The Basic Source Character Set

The C++ standard and the examples in this book are written using the
basic source character set consisting of the letters, digits, graphical
characters, and whitespace characters in the U.S. variant of the
international 7-bit character set ISO 646-1983 called ASCII
(ANSI3.4-1968). This can cause problems for people who use C++ in an
environment with a different character set:
  - ASCII contains punctuation characters and operator symbols (such as
    ], {, and !) that are not available in some character sets.
  - We need a notation for characters that do not have a convenient
    character representation (such as newline and "the character with
    value 17").
  - ASCII doesn't contain characters (such as ñ, Þ, Æ) that are used
    for writing languages other than English.
To use an extended character set for source code, a programming
environment can map the extended character set into the basic source
character set in one of several ways, for example, by using universal
character names (§6.2.3.2).
