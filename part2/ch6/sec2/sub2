6.2.2 Booleans

A boolean, bool, can have one of the two values true or false. A
Boolean is used to express the results of logical operations. For
example:

  void f(int a, int b)
  {
      bool b1 {a==b};
      // ...
  }

If a and b have the same value, b1 becomes true; otherwise, b1 becomes
false.
  A common use of bool is as the type of the result of a function that
tests some condition (a predicate). For example:

  bool is_open(File*);

  bool greater(int a, int b) { return a>b; }

By definition, true has the value 1 when converted to an integer and
false has the value 0. Conversely, integers can be implicitly converted
to bool values: nonzero integers convert to true and 0 converts to
false. For example:

  bool b1 = 7; // 7!=0, so b becomes true
  bool b2 {7}; // error: narrowing (ยง2.2.2, ยง10.5)

  int i1 = true; // i1 becomes 1
  int i2 {true}; // i2 becomes 1

If you prefer to use the {}-initializer syntax to prevent narrowing,
yet still want to convert an int to a bool, you can be explicit:

  void f(int i)
  {
      bool b {i!=0};
      // ...
  }

In arithmetic and logical expressions, bools are converted to ints;
integer arithmetic and logical operations are performed on the
converted values. If the result needs to be converted back to bool, a 0
is converted to false and a nonzero value is converted to true. For
example:
